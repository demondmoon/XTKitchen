## XT's Kitchen

I built this website from ground-up by using React, Firebase and google map api.

The design of the website was inspired by a pizza restaurant near my home. Eating pizza all the time is not healthy, so my website only offers food that 'looks healthy'. You can make an order, but I don't have enough money to hire a chef at the moment.
